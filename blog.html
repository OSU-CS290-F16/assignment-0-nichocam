        <h3>Assignment 0: 25 September, 2016</h3>
        <p>Assignment 0 (or Assignment &#8709 as I like to call it) was an enjoyable assignment. In the following paragraphs I will answer 
           the desired questions about challenges, learning, and resources. While I did run in to a few problems, none of them took longer 
           than 10-20 minutes to solve. I wish I could say this automatically means I learned something, but we've all seen people struggle 
           with the same problem time and time again. I did learn a few things, but nothing major. Most of what I learned were minutia from 
           various websites, which will be detailed in the fourth paragraph.</p>

        <p>The first thing to cover is the difficulties that I ran into. I've already made a Piazza problem about the first problem I 
           encountered, which was Git Classroom refusing to allow me even accept the assignment to begin with. I researched the problem 
           and found that this problem could be caused by me not verifying email. I've been using Git for over a year, so I knew this 
           wasn't the problem so I kept looking. Occasionally this eror occurs when an instructor is signed in, I had no control over this,
           so I kept looking. I found several threads abuot people encountering this problem without a solution, merely promises to fix it.
           Eventually I just got frustrated I kept clicking the assignment button to try to punish github. Surprisingly this solution 
           actually worked. The next problem I ran into was my website was not viewable because I didn't set the permissions correctly. 
           After reading the post on Piazza about permissions I change mine on flip using Putty. Beyond that the only problems I ran into 
           were how to make the &#60 and &#62 symbols.</p>

        <p>Since I've already taken CS 275, CS 361, CS 362, and CS 444 there weren't many things I didn't know about this assignment. I 
           have made websites before, and I've used Git. The joke McGrath tells a lot is that Linus Torvalds likes to name everything 
           after himself, which is why he named his version control software Git. My problem getting Git to let me accept the assignment 
           is a classic example of why you should wait to see if your code is any good before naming it after yourself. My first three 
           websites in the next paragraph demonstrate that this has been an ongoing issue for at eleast a year. The main things I learned 
           were specific symbols, and picture formatting.</p>

        <p>My first problem has existed since <a href="https://github.com/education/classroom/issues/266">last</a> September, at the very 
           least. There have been <a href="https://github.com/education/classroom/issues/364">several</a>
           <a href="https://github.com/education/classroom/issues/581">follow ups</a> but 
           <a href="https://piazza.com/class/itak4ltn3kt46k?cid=8">I</a> still experienced the problem. My second problem was solved by 
           reading Albert Morgan's post on <a href="https://piazza.com/class/itak4ltn3kt46k?cid=21">Piazza.</a> As for what I learned, I 
           used <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_symbols.asp">w3schools.com</a> to display the appropriate symbols, and format
           <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp">images</a> to the desired size. Those are literally the only websites 
           I used for this assignment.</p>
