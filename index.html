                <ul>
                    <li>I am a senior CS major. I'm going for a degree in graphics and game development.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>The answer to this question: on a scale from 0 (I've never seen HTML code) to 10 (You know Facebook? I wrote that.), how 
                confident are you in your web development skills.
                <ul>
                    <li>Probably about a 4. I've made a few websites with groups.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The answer to this question: what do you hope to learn from this class?
                <ul>
                    <li>WebGL, embedding .exe files, and css. I made a website for CS 275 with a partner, but the CSS wouldn't work on 
                        mine.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The answer to this question: have you signed up for Piazza?
                <ul>
                    <li>Yes</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A description of the most interesting fact about you or the most unique experience you've had. Include only what you can 
                think of and write down in two minutes, maximum.
                <ul>
                    <li>It depends on who you ask. Some people find that fact that I am ordained interesting, others are more surprised 
                        that I own 4 top hats (I always wear one to finals). I personally like to brag about the fact that I have a piece 
                        of a Transformer from the first movie. Additionally I was a Sonar Tech in the Navy and have been to Hong Kong 
                        where I saw the world's largest, freestanding, sitting Buddha on Lantau Island, Thailand where I had a 
                        cheese-stuffed-sausage stuffed crust pizza, Malaysia, and two ports in Japan: Shimizu and Yokosuka.</li>
                </ul>
